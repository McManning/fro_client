Building fro
------------

Hah. Good luck with that ... Oh, you're serious?

**Dependencies**

* [SDL](http://libsdl.org/)
* Freetype
* libpng
* zlib
* libjpeg

100% chance you'll have to roll your own build solution. Mine is a DevC++ project imported into Code::Blocks (I know, horrid). I've even got the dependencies loading from DevC++'s lib folder. If I ever pick this up as an active project again, I'll be sure to put in a proper build solution (see below for details on why this isn't the case).


Project status
------------

I'm not actively working on it. It was a hobby project that spanned various different forms, a lot of additions and removals that sort of made the codebase a mess to work with. I've been trying to clean it up from time to time, but since it's only casually used by a couple of people, and it's relatively stable(ish), I haven't put much work into it. If I had a particular artistic direction with the project, or some public demand, I'd start working on it again. Or something similar.
