
Changelog for fro/drm restructuring, following the Build 1.0.3 release. 

[There are quite a few missing logs. Mostly details regarding the Map Editor and Object Editor]

091112
- Converted Map to a Frame to allow children
- Added console as Map::mChat, seperate from the system console.
- WIDGET_FRAME type children will now fire ResizeChildren() when parent frame fires ResizeChildren()
- Fixed url clicking (SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN wasn't being passed, guiManager gave hasKeyFocus the event, not hasMouseFocus)
- Fixed local actor only being able to move when the map or game::mMap::mChat is focused
- Fixed #define issue for WIN32 (now being defined in core/Common.h until a fix can be found that doesn't involve windows.h global inclusion)
- Fixed several bugs with map downloading
	Currently have tested:
	-Linked resource not found serverside (embedded php error code)
	-Linked resource references a file not found on the server
- StaticObject now deletes cached resources it fails to load. 
- Key focus is passed to Map::mChat::mInput when Map::HasKeyFocus()

091113
- Removed Frame resizing fill color default (until we can find a faster alpha-blending rect renderer)
- Added login dialog and welcome message reader
- Added avatar favorites dialog
- Starting adding command hooks to Map::mChat
- Reimplemented and fixed input box history (pageup/pagedown accessible)
- Added /music command (Might later add a winamp plugin to grab info directly from the app)
- Added MessagePopup dialog
	May need to rewrite this, or write another version that is more like message boxes.

091114
- Added inventory dialog
- Added encryption to dorra amount
- Added a message to appear when player tries to use an inventory item (placeholder until they actually have a use)
- Fixed the allowance of null activate timers. (Timers can now be used simply as a marker that exists only for X milliseconds) 
- Fixed issue where timer callback return values were ignored
- Added right click menu to remote actors
- Fixed various issues regarding mOrigin/mPosition for entities (Confusion regarding the purpose of the two)
- Added beat command (accessible via character right click menu), with a 10 second interval between acceptible uses. 
- Fixed screenshot saving
- Added alert message to gui, rendered in top left for predefined number of seconds (10sec)
- Added shortcut editor, and shortcuts applied to function keys 1 through 8, with a 10 second interval between acceptible uses. 
- Added MessageManager to dispatch messages between classes.
- Changed gui's event handler for SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP back to hasKeyFocus (instead of hasMouseFocus)
	It was causing issues with scrollbars and such. Basically, need to find something to satisfy all situations.

091115-091125
- Changed multilines url clicking. Now single right click to open url in default browser.
- Added server queue to IrcNet2 and the ability to go through the queue, connecting to each server in order (In case a connection fails)
- Changed welcome response xml to set multiple servers, and a special section for starting map id.
- Improved overall design of login process
- Moved game console to GameManager instead of Map, so it can be accessed without a map, and doesn't lose backlogs.
- Linked IrcNet2 into GameManager, and added IrcNet handler callbacks. 
- Changed MessagePopup class to use labels instead of multilines
	TODO: Make variation using multilines

091126
- Added widget focus stack to gui to solve the issue of multiple widgets demanding focus at once.
- Changed default settings for system console, making it seem more like a SYSTEM console. 

091128
- Implemented game-specific messages, and created compatibility with previous client versions.
	TODO: The code for this though is a complete mess, and thrown in LocalActor and IrcNetListeners. Requires reorganization.
	- Action buffer (de)compression should be moved to MovingEntity
	- avatarPropertiesToPacket and visaversa should be moved to MovingEntity, or create an Avatar class 
		that handles serialization and maintains avatarProperties within it. 
- Changed beat command to only work when within a certain distance of the target (Currently set to 100 pixels from origin->origin)
- Changed the way nick changes are displayed. Will now only announce the change when the affected player is within a certain distance. (Same as chat range)
- Combined /me, /music, and beat into the 'act' message. Now takes various forms:
	act $message - /me command (also supporting act 0 $message. First is for backwards compatibility)
	act 1 $song - /music command
	act 2 $nick $item - beat command
- Fixed a bug that caused various console commands to crash. (This bug also occured in previous versions)
- Fixed issue where RemoteActor/LocalActor wouldn't sync to the current pose state after loading a new avatar.
- Added in a semi-hacky parameter to Entity::ReadXml that lets it differentiate between online/offline loading mode. 
	This way we can change resource directories and behavior.
- Changed downloader to forcibly kill threads on Flush rather than wait. (So we don't hang on shutdown) Don't know if this is an appropriate solution.
- Added right click menu to Input widget.
- Added common operation functions to Input widget (Cut(), Copy(), Paste(), etc)
- Added paste color operation to Input widget (both in right click menu and linked to ctrl+b) 
	Will open a color picker dialog and request the user to create a color that will then be copied into the input at the cursor.
- Renamed Widget::DemandKeyFocus() to Widget::SetKeyFocus() to lessen the confusion with Widget::DemandFocus(), since it's not necessarily a demand.

091204
- Added options dialog
- Changed the way right clicking urls work. It will now open a dialog asking to either save to clipboard or open in browser.
- Added ALT key combos to the Game Manager.
	Alt+o: Options
	Alt+r: Radar
	Alt+i: Inventory
	Alt+a: Avatars
	Alt+s: Shortcuts
- Added game_config xml to save configuration settings seperate from the core engine. 
- Optimized Font renderer a bit. 
	
091205
- Fixed bug in Options Dialog that blocked certain options from being changed 
	(A bug which has existed for quite some, and no one reported it)
- Fixed console timestamp settings being modified when the option was changed
- Changed structure of game_config to include login information
- Added cutoff filesize for the downloader (sendHttpGet). If a file stream is larger than the set size 
	(currently 3MB) it will stop, delete the destination file, and return failure.
- Fixed right click menus vanishing when clicked off.
- Fixed issue with key focus screwing up player movement input
- Fixed bug that would remove local actor from the map after a map change

091209
- Added DataPacket class to manage the structure of network packets. 
- Added Avatar class to manage avatar properties (Will make things easier as Avatars become more complex).
- Fixed some bugs with the network
- Moved loading avatar information to MovingEntity (Was currently a set of functions/variables cloned in both LocalActor & RemoteActor)
- Fixed key focus issue when a map loads
- Fixed issue with player moving while map was loading
- Fixed bug in network state which caused it to switch from connecting->disconnected->connected

091214
- Added scrolling (arrow keys) to the Object Editor to make large object editing easier
- Added background color editing to OE. Use oe_background \cRGB to change the background.
- Added grid toggle to Object Editor (F3) and Map Editor (g)
- Added delete key support to inputs
- Fixed bug that allowed any avatar dimensions for MNGs.

091216
- Fixed bug with scrollbars not readjusting after being initialized with zero height. 
- Added application flags to boot up map editor and object editor, without starting up game manager.
	Flags are: -oe or -me
- Added object collision rects display to ME
- Added byte caps per each download in the downloader. Use DownloadManager::SetByteCap(int) to 
	set the cap before ::QueueDownload. But the cap must be reset afterward if this is a temporary change.
	(Reason it's not a parameter in QueueDownload is due to the deep levels of class functions between 
		resman->LoadImg and downloader->QueueDownload. It's too excessive to add a parameter at each level)
- Gave player avatars a unique (lower) maximum filesize to avoid the spam of MB-level avatars. (Capped at 200 KB)
- Switched frame change checks from Image::Render() to their own timer (for images with multiple frames)
- Added a render optimization system that only called a full Render() when something changed. 
	However, while useful for gui applications, the introduction of animated images maxes out the FPS anyway. 
	The only true way of fixing this is to redraw & update only the rects that have been modified
		however this is incredibly more complicated and not in the domain of my patience. 
- Improved the NextServer system when trying to connect
- Improved detection of failures while connecting and loading a map
- Fixed bug where it wouldn't detect a disconnection
	Currently only displays a "You've been disconnected" message. Maybe attempt reconnect cycles?
- Fixed several other bugs in the network connection state handling
- Fixed bug with players having a blank avatar locally when theirs didn't load on initial LocalActor startup.
- Fixed a bug with stripping \cRGB at the end of a string
- Blocked local file LocalActor avatars from being saved to game config
- Added private messaging
- Added emote system. 
- Adjusted readFormattedNumber() to return the center of a tile rather than the topleft for tx inputs.
- Added userlist (alt+u)
- Fixed issue with joining online maps with no channel ID (There's still other bugs though).
	Overall, the connection procedure still needs to be improved upon, simplified, handle all errors, etc.
- Fixed bug with bad reporting on how many map resources we actually have
- Added delay range to map objects (delay="low-high") however, when cloning this range is ignored and it 
	instead just uses whatever the original uses. So that needs to be fixed.

091218
- Improved handling of channel kicks, bans, bad server responses, etc.
- Fixed issue where the map would be displayed even if we didn't join the channel properly
- Fixed bug that caused names to remain in the userlist when we leave channels
- Combined inventory xml into a general purpose player data xml file.
- Added -nologin application flag to bypass the forced login and load a default map (from online resource, but played locally)
- Added player level hud that has no purpose besides to confuse people.
- Added nickname storage to IrcNet
- Fixed bug in IrcNet where our channel wouldn't be deleted when we were kicked.

091220
- Fixed bug with using \cRGB in widget hover text
- Fixed bug where single frame MNGs wouldn't display
- Fixed Show Player Names option
- Fixed bug that allowed people to set their max FPS below 5, which was not a very smart thing to do, but happened regardless.
- Moved spawn & map dimension properties to <layout>
- Added console command 'server addr:port' to manually connect to a server, and bypass login.
- Added new jumping system (currently using the tab key, will change later)
- Added map gravity affector to jumping, Map::SetGravity(uShort). Default gravity is 1, higher jumping if higher values.
- Improved <object> structure to save full image file names instead of the id + extension 
- Changed the way entity layers are defined. Will now be defined in the entity xml itself, and not the map <layout>
	The idea is that there aren't any entities that would need to exist on different layers.
	And if the case would ever occur, two different entity XMLs can be created (However, hopefully it won't be necessary).
- Added oe_layer <0, 1, or 2> command to OE to set the default layer for the object.
- Added spawn point edit mode to ME. (s key to toggle)
- Added map dimensions calculation to ME. Will output a width/height big enough to contain all entities on the map.

091221
- Fixed a bug with avatars. When one stopped moving, the frame would continue to play till the end, even if !LoopStand
- Added SceneActor class and the associated <actor> to map entities and <layout>.
	However, no editor supports this type, so they must be manually created.
- Fixed yet another bug with looping stand frames for avatars (Wouldn't loop _move_#)
- Added Avatar Viewer (alt+v)
- Fixed bug where 0 interval timers would create an infinite loop. 
- Added Open File dialog (Although it's currently only an input widget)
- Fixed invalid pointer bug when two avatars used the same image (via avatar1 = avatarb copy operator)
- Added hud buttons for the alt+letter dialogs. Toggles between two hud modes via topleft symbol.

091222
- Fixed several bugs in the Image class regarding animation
- Fixed a bug regarding MNG animation. Now uses Loop Sit/Stand for MNGs too.
- Fixed jump syncing between clients by holding the outbound movement buffer until we land, and sending our landing point
	along with it (In theory, this should also fix the issues with local client having a solid where remote clients do not,
	and auto-correcting for that conflict)
- Added LocalActor::mLoadingAvatar serialization to NetSendState if the LocalActor::mAvatar is null
- Added one minute timeout timer to connecting and awaiting verification net states. Once it times out, it will attempt to
	disconnect (if waiting for verification) and connect to the next server in the list.
	NOTE: UNTESTED!
	
091223
- Added a multiline mode to MessagePopup for longer messages
- Added <alert> and <msg> to post-login xml reader.
- Fixed bug where the correct avatar wouldn't be sent on first map join

091227
- Implemented MessageData, allowing MessageManager to use a more informative messaging system. 
	(ie: attaches keys to values, rather than simply having numerical indexes and trying to match up index->value in listeners)

091229
- Added position memorization to system console and GameManager's chat console (Each saved to their own config)
- Fixed bug that caused maps to still load even if a layout Actor had no unique resource to clone from.
- Changed Multiline(&Console)::AddAdvMessage to AddFormattedMessage

091230
- Added item trading. By doing this, I installed 5 new net packets (each with a 'tr' prefix), three related classes, and
	additional controls to the inventory and remote player menu. 
- Fixed a bug with Labels not returning the right value for Width() when MaxWidth() is 0. 
- Changed Actor::Emote() where it'll pop the chat bubble before displaying an emote. 
- Fixed issue where jumping map entities wouldn't queue a resort as their Y positions changed. (Actor::Move() now flags a resort)
- Added option to disable trade requests, and moved Accept Private Messages option to network tab
- Implemented warp destination objects and warp destination points (At least, reading. But not setting)
- Added destination point parameter to GameManager::JoinOnlineMap()

091231
- Implemented message ENTITY_MOVE in Actor::ProcessMovement() (Actually only sent by Actor classes. Should it be ACTOR_MOVE?)
- Implemented message ENTITY_SAY in BubbleManager::CreateBubble()
- Implemented message ENTITY_CREATE in EntityManager::DispatchEntityCreateMessage()
	Must be called alongside AddEntity to avoid a conflict with loading entities in the background during a new map load.
	(Scripts of the old map would be sent the event and believe the entities to exist on the displayed map)

100101
- Fixed bug where ENTITY_MOVE wasn't sent if we jumped into a solid and stopped short. 

100104
- Added TextObject entity (However, it only exists in <layout> and doesn't have a unique ref)
- Added /stamp command to write text directly to the map (Deletes itself after 5 minutes)
- Added colorizing to Avatar Creator
- Added grid snapping option to Map Editor (toggled with 'n')

100105
- Added adjustable surface flags to Screen
- Set game window to be static sized, while other apps get a resizeable gui.
- Changed map resource versioning from using version numbers to md5 hashes of the files.
	If an entity lacks an md5 hash property, it will assume the cached version is always correct.
- Added create_actor <id> <w> <h> command to console so that we can easily output SceneActor xml without
	the need of a full blown editor (Main importance is that it does an md5 hash on the image file)
- Added ITEM_USE messenger event when someone clicks use item in the inventory
- Fixed bug with remote player nick changing
- Added me_addscript <id> and me_removescript <id>. It'll add the script names to the .res, and make sure
	it exists on disk, but won't actually load the script.
- Added Actor placement in the Map Editor
- Fixed calculation errors in Entity::CollidesWith()
- Fixed ambiguity issues as to whether entity collision rects are relative to origin or top left image position.

100107
- Fixed bug in file->string loading (Screwed up when dealing with newlines)
- Implemented LuaManager, EventsLib, and SystemLib
- Fixed bug in loading/saving script resources in Map Editor
- Added offline map test mode. Console command: test_map id. Will load from editor/maps/, editor/entities/, etc.
	Made to work with the output from the Map Editor.
- Fixed bug that caused Object Editor to save full editor/entity/ path to saved entities resource filenames
- Added oe_warp <mapId> <entityName> to Object Editor. Send oe_warp without parameters to erase properties.

100108
- Added Timers library to lua. (Timers.Add, .Remove, and .RemoveAll)
- Fixed bug with single framed MNG avatars being considered invalid.

100109
- Improved lua error reporting
- Added Entity library to lua

100110
- Fixed Dorra saving/loading
- Fixed negative Dorra amount in inventory
- Added Player library to lua
- Added Entity::SetFlag & Entity::GetFlag. Flags are arbitrary keys associated with values, can be used to 
	maintain information on a per-entity basis. Might add entity flag persistency between maps.
- Added LocalActor::LoadFlags/SaveFlags to save Entity flags to file in order to maintain persistency.
- Fixed bug in XmlFile::SetText() (Wouldn't add a text node to an element if it didn't already exist).
- Added encryption to entity flags
- Fixed bug where the inventory listing would reverse order every reload
- Added Actor library to lua. Not yet sure if this should be combined with Entity or not.
- Fixed Entity::SetLayer so that it actually works
- Changed lua userdata to use the lua Registry for storage. This way we have full access to all lua objects,
	including tables and functions, rather than simply numbers, strings, and cptrs.

100111
- Added Convo library to lua
- Fixed an issue with bad pointers in SDL_Frame::key when using Image conversion routines
- Can now read in directions from xml, or lua, by using either keypad numbers (7 = SOUTHEAST, etc) or string representation ("se" = SOUTHEAST)
- Fixed a bug with Actor direction updating (Avatar wouldn't update at the right time when the direction updated)
- Added Actor::IgnoreSolids
- Fixed Actor::MoveTo. Doesn't use pathfinding or anything yet, but it does set the destination and try to move to it dumbly. 
	(Ie: Walks into walls if there are any in their path). This will still follow the 9 direction rules, and they won't move in obscure angles.

100112
- Redesigned the Hud to contain all links in three sub menus
- Added Report A Bug feature (Opens link to sybolt.com/tracker report page)
- Added Camera library to lua
- Fixed bug with MNG frame selection. Actor::_recalculateDirection() was at fault, and decided to break everything with SetDirection()

100113
- Added console command map_info to toggle extra map data (collision, origins, destinations, etc)
- Invalid md5 values in entity xml (such as md5="1") will now force the game to redownload resources even if they exist already. 
	This is not a bug, but a feature for testing maps when it becomes an annoyance to re-hash the file every time. 
	(However, for RELEASE versions, there needs to be a hash!)
- Added the ability to disable player input. Also accessible by lua with Player.IsLocked() and Player.Lock(1 | 0)
- Added PLAYER_ACTION messenger event, sent out when the player hits enter while the map has our input focus and the chat input is empty.
- Added depth rendering to StaticObjects. Will sink actors into the objects when they traverse over them. 
- Added a testing Weapon class to mess around with.

100114 - Terra Day!
- Added TerrainTest class and -terra app option to boot it up. Currently used as my tool to figure out how to do terrain painting
	properly, and without any errors. 

100115 - Attack Day!
- Added ATTACK action to Actors. Do not SetAction(ATTACK) directly though, call Actor::Attack(cooldown).
	Also do not use GetAction(ATTACK), but use IsAttacking(). (GetAction can still return ATTACK, even though the attack has ended.
	The action will not change until the actor moves). Attack is added to the action buffer as 'aXX.' where XX is a number indicating
	attack cooldown (Actors buffer will not continue processing until the cooldown has been completed)
- Added support for _attack_2, _attack_4, etc to both PNG and MNG avatars. (PNG will have rows 9 through 12 (after 4 sit frames))
	Will play when the actor attacks, and will pause at the last frame until the actor moves again. 
	(Currently there is no option to loop, and I doubt that I'll make one)
- Added ENTITY_ATTACK event ( only fired by Actor::Attack() ) Contains "entity" (userdata) and "cooldown" (int)
- Added ENTITY_ENDATTACK event. Fired after ENTITY_ATTACK when the cooldown time is reached. Contains "entity" (userdata)
- Added the ability to skip attack animation and cooloff within a single call for Attack(). This is done by calling
	Actor::SkipAttack() from within an event listener on ENTITY_ATTACK. From within lua, call Actor.SkipAttack()
	This is benefitial for when we use the attack key to talk to friendly NPCs, and make it not look like we're trying to hit them.
- Added to lua: 
	Actor.SkipAttack() (useable only in ENTITY_ATTACK listeners)
	Actor.GetProp() Additions:
		"canattack" - returns 1 if we're capable of attacking (Not in a cooldown stage, or similar constraint). 0 otherwise.
		"attacking" - returns 1 if we're currently in an attack (waiting for cooldown). 
			1 in between ENTITY_ATTACK and ENTITY_ENDATTACK events. 0 otherwise.
	Actor.Attack(actor, cooldown<DEFAULT_ATTACK_COOLDOWN>) - Force the actor to attack, and wait cooldown milliseconds before 
	being able to do anything. ENTITY_ENDATTACK event will be fired after that amount of milliseconds.
- Disabled PLAYER_ACTION due to conflict with the chat input. Will later decide whether to keep this, or just rely on ENTITY_ATTACK
- Rebuilt the map loading system. Now uses a seperate class for map loading (WorldLoader) linked to GameManager. There is also 
	no more background map loading, and when the map goes to load, you will be removed from your current map and the new map will
	load in. This opens up the ability to have some sort of cool loading event happening (map crumbling, or something), fixes several
	issues with scripting, and removes headaches.

100116 - Avatar Day!
- Added an overload to LoadAvatar in RemoteActor to restrict them to only http:// and avy:// avatars. Disallowing attempts at accessing 
	local files.
- (UNTESTED) Added support for avy:// composite avatars in Avatar class.
	Final Url Format: avy://Base.HeadId.HeadHex.BodyId.BodyHex.HairId.HairHex
		Example: avy://adult.default.FF0000.default.00FFCC.afro.666666
- Fixed a bug with SDL_CopySurface (wouldn't copy properly if src wasn't 32 BPP. Now creates a 32bit copy before proceeding)
- Sped up SDL_CopySurface when dealing with copying full images
- Implemented Avatar Modifiers. Currently support MOD_MINI, MOD_GIANT, MOD_SMASH
- Fixed memory leak in Avatar class
- Added "mod" to Actor.GetProp and Actor.SetProp. Returns and sets the avatar modifier. Values are relative to the avatar mod enum.
	MOD_NONE = 0, MOD_TARANDFEATHER = 1 (not working yet), MOD_MINI = 2, MOD_GIANT = 3, MOD_SMASH = 4, and more to come later on.
- Implemented "mod" message for avatar modifier notifications over the network
- Implemented modifier data in avatar (de)serialization
- Added ENTITY_DESTROY event message, triggered when an entity is deleted from the map (Does not ever fire for LocalActor)
- Improved greyscale colorization
- Fixed a bug that caused images created through ResourceManager::NewImage not to state SDL_Image::LOADED

100117
- Added PAL Lessons button to login screen (not yet useable)
- Added the ability to load maps in offline mode, but still use online resources
- Fixed bug with downloader deleting local files we didn't want it to
- Improved how drm live-downloads images we don't already have. 
- Added Achievements system. Added to lua: Player.EarnAchievement and Player.GetAchievement
- Added My Achievements dialog

100120
- Added unique handles to timers
- Change Timers.Add() in lua to return the handle
- Added Timers.RemoveHandle(handle) in lua
- Changed the structure of lua timer callbacks. 
	Now in the form: function callback(handle, interval, userdata)
- Added unique handles to event listeners
- Added Events.UnregisterHandle(handle) in lua
- Changed Events.Register to accept optional userdata as a third parameter, and to return a handle to the new timer
- Changed the structure of event listener callbacks. 
	Now in the form: function callback(handle, eventId, datatable, userdata)
- Added Entity.Remove(entity) and Entity.RemoveAllMatching("id") to support deletion of entities from the map
- Changed Player.SetCash to Player.AddCash(amt), where it'll add (or subtract if amt < 0) from our dorra

100122
- Forced a minute delay between /join attempts (It's basically masking a bug involving rapid joinings that crash the client)
	This delay is ignored if we just tried to /join a map but it failed.
- Disabled /join while already loading a map
- Added the beta Avatar Creator to the hud
- Fixed bug with remote actors not loading a default avatar
- Fixed bug that caused a crash when remote actors with no avatar parted the channel
- Fixed double ENTITY_CREATE messages being sent when remote actors join
- Added user login credentials to map config request urls (Now we can restrict access to certain users)
- Fixed bug with jumping while sitting
- Added custom error messages for map load errors. 
	(Defineable serverside if <error>msg</error> is the only thing returned from master.php)
	
100123
- Added LocalActor::Warp(). It should be able to properly use the editor dir when warping from editor dir maps, and cache otherwise.
- Implemented Player.Warp() in lua
- Disabled chatbox completely when loading a map

100125
- Fixed crashing bug when someone talks right before leaving the channel
- Added position and rotation data to stamp packet, to make sure these values are the same across all clients.
- Added optional md5 hash check to DownloadManager. If a hash is provided, will do the download failure callback with errorCode DEC_BADHASH
	when the resulting file's hash doesn't match the one provided in QueueDownload.
- Fixed bug that had active="0" lua scripts to load in memory, instead of active="1"
- Fixed a bug that caused blank strings to be dropped in DataPacket decryption, and thus causing fatal crashes. 
	(explode() was written to ignore them) Added an option to explode() to toggle the addition of blank filler strings in the result
- Fixed bug with confirming a trade when you never sent an item (would give the other user a blank named item with a random amount and cost)
- Added Game library to lua (only consisting of Game.Print() currently)

100127
- Added privmsg button to trade dialog
- Added GAIN_ITEM and LOSE_ITEM messenger events
- Added default settings generation if savegame doesn't exist.
- Fixed static link to http://localhost in MyAchievements

----- RELEASED AS 1.1.0 BETA (TO DEVELOPERS) -----

100128
- Added \cRGB support to stamps

100201
- Increased socket read buffers to 1024*10 bytes in an attempt to better handle higher amounts of players.

100205
- Added OpenUrl support to entities. If their NAME starts with http://, will open that url when right clicked.
- Fixed infinite-avatar loading bug when avy:// url has a file not found or other issue
- Moved saved avatar and general user settings to savegame file
- Add to Favorites button in AC now also sets your current avatar as the creation

100206
- Reduced amount of times NM response is sent. Will now only send to the channel once per every 3 seconds. This should
	account for splits while remaining low-bandwith.
- Added an additional check for users who aren't registered on the map. If someone sends valid data and aren't on our map,
	the client will attempt to get a NM response from them. 
- Increased item description length to 200 characters
- Added coloring to stamps, by using \cRGB. However, it only works if \cRGB prefixes the message (There's a bug with 
	rendering text to a newly created blank surface)
- Implemented warp properties for objects
- Added overload to Player.Warp() in lua. Can either be .Warp("world", x, y) or .Warp("world", "objectname") or just .Warp("world")
- Changed lua Entity.NewTextObject() to entity_ptr Entity.NewTextObject(text, x, y, size<default_font_size>, layer<1>, rotation<0.0>)
	
100211
- Improved detection of malformed sup/nm messages (Malformed sup message could cause a crash to an entire channel)
- Changed EarnAchievement() to return the current number of points in an achievement, or 0 if an error occured
- Included several built in achievements and using /game/Achievements.h to maintain all related code (Checks, timers, etc).
- Added system that allows the Helios AI to give achievements
- Added getPreviousFileMatchingPattern() and fixed the back buttons in the AC
- Set title color to a light grey for achievements that are visible, but not yet earned.

100212
- Wrote a MiniMenu class however haven't implemented it yet (Don't know exactly how to do so efficiently).
- Fixed bug with right clicking map entities that would cause a crash 
- Moved /assets/achievements/ to /cache/achievements/

----- PUBLIC RELEASE AS 1.1.0 BETA -----

100215
- {Report:0000018} Moved game_config to assets/game.cfg, config to assets/system.cfg, playersave to assets/player.save, 
	avatars to avatars.xml, shortcuts to shortcuts.xml. All of these may need to be moved/adjusted again, I want to centralize
	a folder for people to copy files over for updates. (Or, a folder that'll be ignored while updating)
- {Report:0000017} Fixed inbound stamp messages not being read properly
- {Report:0000013} Fixed game config settings not being saved/loaded properly after a default savegame file was created.
	(Specific xml elements weren't created, and thus always returned zeros)
- {Report:0000014} Fixed F8 crash and shortcuts not working as they were supposed to
- Reduced shortcut use delay to 5 seconds instead of 10
- {Report:0000015} MAY have added a fix regarding focus problems with dialogs are closed, and the window is Alt+Tabbed to, however
	the problem seems to be Vista related and I am unable to reproduce at this time.

100219
- {Request: Morthm} Added /commands and /emotes

100222
- Fixed rendering of caption buttons
- Moved system console toggle from Esc to Home key
- Changed Esc key to open the quick menu (generic menu to return to login, quit, or other constantly used options)
- Added steam:// url support (However, only copying to clipboard works, unless end users figure out a way to shell execute steam urls)

100226
- Added frame limit to avatars (set to 50 frames max) to prevent overflow crashes
- Disabled GIF avatar support temporarily. This is to prevent the chance of crashing a channel, since there is currently a fatal bug 
	in the GIF loader. GIF format is still acceptable for map objects, however. Just nothing that requires the Avatar class to render.
- Moved nick settings to player.save, and moved player.save back to the main directory
- Changed the deleteSource property in SDL_Image and ResourceManager to deleteSourceIfInvalid, to only delete invalid downloaded images.
- Fixed a bug where invalid achievement icons would remain in the folder and never attempt to re-download
- Added an automated reply when someone tries to privmsg you and you have private messages blocked.
- Added channel-wide message when an achievement is earned, detailing who earned what achievement.
- Changed the way the offline map tester reads the .xml files. Will want all elements to be inside <map> rather than toplevel.
- Map Editor now outputs full <map> .xml's (But still without the <resource> section, still will use .res files).

100227
- Added /ghost and /normalize commands for avy mods. (Normalize to return the avatar to the default state)
- Fixed a bug where NetSendAvyMod() would crash the client if not on a channel
- Added support for Winamp in /music. Type /music without anything after it to attempt to find Winamp
- Added ActionEffect entity class to display comic-effects for attacks/actions (Work in progress). Currently set to display
	a MISS effect whenever the attack key is used.
- Added details regarding target (x,y) and objectName to map config request from master.php. This way we can further control 
	warping. 
- player.save file will now be written to every time it's modified, to further prevent data loss during a crash. 

100301
- Added persistant flags to maps, saved to player.save
- Added Game.SetMapFlag("flag", "value") and Game.GetMapFlag("flag") to Lua to access said persistant map flags
- Added System.GenerateFilename("key") to lua to generate a cache filename from the specified key, that won't collide with any
	other cache files unless they too called .GenerateFilename() with the same key from a lua script.
- Removed the match check for internal ID and file ID for entities. Internal IDs can now be different, possibly
	allowing subfolders for entity storage but still having a different internal-use ID for maps. But.. not yet tested.

100305
- Removed MD5 hashing of user passwords to/from master/login. This is to make things work alongside our newer login system,
	as it requires serverside SHA1 with some special salts. 
- Removed MD5 hashing from the Object Editor
- Added support for sub directory entities in OE
- Improved grid rendering in ME/OE to use a cached image rather than drawing rects directly. A LOT less cpu intensive.
- Fixed OnUnload() lua functions of the previous map being called after a new map is already being loaded. 
- Added emoticon icon that appears when earning an achievement
- Decided to trash the "Unique Entity" management system, and to restructure maps slightly in a more organized fashion. 
	- Temporarily removed ME & OE & offline map running in order to clean up the system
	- Old Method for spawning entities:
		- During map load, each entity in <resources> would get one unique instance loaded into memory
		- Each entity load after that will make a direct copy of that first entity loaded into memory
		Problem: Waste of memory, overcomplicated things
	- New Method:
		- Each entity load will read the settings in the map xml and build itself accordingly
		Derp, why didn't I do this before? Mainly had to do with the way the map editor kept track of things, but that was dumb.
- Removed Entity.Clone(entity); from lua. Entity.Add("classname") is the method of choice
- Overall, adopted more of an "entity factory" way of doing things, creating individual instances from templates. 
	This method has been used in a lot of games, and although I attempt to try something different, I still resulted in the 
	old technique (Why try to be unique anymore?).
- Added <scripts> section to the map xml for script resources, and <properties> to contain all global properties 
	(rather than having loose elements flying around).

100315
- Removed exit(0); from MNG_UINT_PLTE size % 3 check failure (Not very nice for a production release).

100320
- Removed Entity.SkipAttack(), Entity.Attack(), and "canattack", "attacking" properties from Entity.GetProp
- Removed any internal attack related matters. Including _attack_ frames for avatars.
- Removed Weapon class
- Removed Radar, Avatar Viewer, Shortcuts, and Remote Player Menu interfaces.
- Removed player level data

100321
- Added Map lua library
- Removed LuaManager class
- Removed loading and xml parsing routines from Map and all inherited classes
- Removed ReadXml/WriteXml routines from Entity and all inherited classes
- Removed lessons button from LoginDialog class
- Removed Entity.Add() from lua
- Fixed options not saving in options dialog

100324
- Added Map.NewBasic(), Map.SetSpawn(), Map.SetSize(), Map.SetColor() to Lua
- Renamed CollectionMap to BasicMap to make it slightly more descriptive
- Fixed several bugs with WorldLoader

100326
- Increased screen size to 800x600 due to popular demand
- Removed server manual connection command.
- Rewrote EntityManager to only utilize one list of entities, and to use a more abstract method when dealing with entity layers.
	Will sort entities based on y position AND layer, which can now be any number. 
- Removed EntityManager::AddEntity overloading and put ENTITY_CREATE message dispatch into the original AddEntity function.
- Added a Die() overload to Map in order to gracefully cleanup certain content before the next map.
	A major issue during map testing was that images (and their associated properties) would not reload from disk as specified,
	and instead simply clone the internally cached data. By forcing lua scripts and entities to be erased from the old map before
	a new map is constructed, we also clear up all leftover resources.
- Removed all references to /lua/MapLib from GameManager
- Fixed bug where userlist wouldn't clear names when changing maps

100327
- Added game mode toggle (toggle between chat and action)
- Added WASD movement (arrow keys still useable), changed jump to space bar, shift keys now toggle speed, ctrl no longer needs a
	direction held down to sit, and tab key toggles between action (movement) and chat modes.
- Re-enabled arrow key support for the chat's console (to move the cursor around).
- Added Player.IsInChatMode() in lua, returns true if the game is currently in chat mode, false if in action mode.
	(This'll be good when we bind via lua certain keys for ingame events)
- Added general purpose Entity::GetImage() to return the Image the entity is using to render. 
	Should usually be overriden depending on entity type
- Added mCanClick to Entity
- Added ability to right click the local player to access the avatar favorites dialog
- Added "clickable" boolean to Entity.SetProp/GetProp
- Converted various properties in Entity.GetProp/SetProp to boolean, where appropriate. (ie: "shadow")
- Added "Clickable = true/false" to Entity.Create() table
- Added shorthand Entity::IsVisibleInCamera()
- Changed listening distance (for displaying nick changes, join/parts, chat messages, etc) from using a constant 
	distance of 300 to using Entity::IsVisibleInCamera()
- Added bad image file check in MyAchievements
- Replaced dropdown menu at the top with a static, limited version.
- Merged game.cfg into player.save

100328a
- Added dispatch of ENTITY_CMD[entity, message] when local or remote actors say something prefixed with slash (/)
	These messages will not be displayed in the chatbox, and rely on scripts to handle them.
- Added another overload to Player.Warp in lua: Player.Warp(x, y); to jump coordinates on current map.
	Shorthand of Entity.SetPosition(Player.GetEntity(), x, y);

100328b (After SVN commit to revision 10)
- Removed /core/widgets/FilePicker.*
- Removed /core/widgets/WidgetImage.*

100331a
- Removed all references to the WidgetImage system and replaced with a cleaner more basic method. 
- Removed gui.xml access and hardcoded styling for all widgets
- Removed dynamic icon loading in MyAchievements and replaced with two basic icons, 
	one for achieved and one for unachieved.

100331b (After SVN commit to revision 11)
- Added error checking to ResourceManager::ImageFromSurface
- Removed links to DownloadManager and active image download states from Image & SDL_Image
- Modified Avatar class to handle downloading and to do cleanup of cache files internally.

100402
- Fix buildDirectoryTree() to build full trees. Ie: a/b/c/d/e when b/c/d/e all don't exist.
- Added online map support to the new WorldLoader
- Completely phased out XML reliance in map loading
- Fixed bug that caused the players action buffer not to send out when they jump to chat state
- Fixed avy:// links not being sent to remote players
- Fixed mouse down and inactive offset calculations in Widget::CalculateImageOffset()
- Implemented import and edit of avy:// urls from Avatar Favorites to Avatar Creator. Now can easily edit existing
	avy:// formatted avatars in AvyFavs without having to add a new one from scratch.
- Removed "feature" due to popular demand, where the AvyFavs window would close after an avatar was selected to wear
- Fixed caption button rendering
- HACK: "Fixed" SmallSelect widget background rendering, with a rather distasteful hack.
- Increased the amount of time avatars.xml is saved (Will now be saved whenever any kind of change is made to the avyfavs)
- Added YesNoPopup class to core/widgets/
- Added System.YesNo() routine
- Added callback function to System.Alert and System.MessageDialog
- Fixed bug that allowed player movement while a widget demands focus

100403
- Added Game.NetSendToChannel("id", "message") and Game.NetSendToNick("nick", "id", "message") to lua
	Will allow script writers to send custom data over the network, and can be watched with an Events.Register("NET_LUA", ...)
	id + message length should be no longer than ~200 characters. And of course, this cannot be used heavily over an irc network
	that throttles channels after too much chatter. Third party servers are required if heavy data transfer is necessary.
	It is not possible to override an existing network message, as "lua" is the REAL header of this packet (while id is the first member)
	This data can only be recieved by those in the same world as the sender. This does not work between worlds.
	NET_LUA
		[string] id
		[userdata] entity - The player that sent the message
		[string] message
- Added Image::IsPixelTransparent()
- Fixed bug with the pixel-level testing for map entity interaction not working for colorkey based images.
- Fixed Entity.FindById()/FindByName() throwing an error when an entity isn't found (should've returned nil)
- Changed the following lua functions to return booleans rather than integers:
	Actor.CanMove(), Actor.LoadAvatar(), Actor.IsLocked(), Camera.IsRectVisible(), Camera.IsEntityVisible(), Events.UnregisterHandle(),
	Timers.RemoveHandle(),
- Removed the following lua functions:
	Actor.NewSceneActor(), 
- Changed Actor.GetAchievement() to return nil if supplied achievement name is not found
- Moved Game.SetMapFlag/GetMapFlag to Map.SetFlag/GetFlag

100404
- Removed Actor.GetProp/SetProp, and streamlined everything into Entity.GetProp/SetProp.
	Can now handle actor and player properties using internal C++ class inheritance.
- Entity.GetProp/SetProp will no longer throw an error if property is invalid, but instead give an error
- Added Player.SetProp("prop", value) and value = Player.GetProp("prop") simply as shorthand
	to Entity.SetProp(Player.GetActor(), "prop", value) etc.
- Added /wtf emote

100410
- Removed Report A Bug button from the hud
- Fixed writing of default player.save
- Changed the way the console reads in the image base parameter. Will use subdirectories to skin all widgets.
- Added a basic RemotePlayerMenu substitute built off the ESC menu structure. 
	Temporary until the real one is made (Because people would complain if they can't beat/trade).

100414 (After SVN commit to revision 18)
- Moved player.save and avatars.xml to ./profile/ subdirectory. 
	Plan on using this to store any consistant settings/configs/data written by the scripting engine
	because files can be erased or overwritten in ./cache/
- (NOT DONE) Added Afk Mode to players
	- Afk mode will display an icon over the head of the player who's currently afk.
	- Afk mode will be activated when the window has been ignored for 5 minutes. 
		Note: Due to limitations in SDL, cannot poll events outside the window without getting involved
			with WinAPI. So instead, afk is more like afw, and will watch multiple things to determine
			afk state. (Basically, if any SDL events come in, they're not afk)
	- Trade requests will auto deny when afk
- Changed Actor.LoadAvatar() to only work for local files in the map working dir
- Added Map::GetWorkingDir() to return the directory our resources must come from.
	"cache/" if online mode, "dev/" if edit mode
- Changed Entity.Create() to only allow access to files where Map::GetWorkingDir() is the root
	So for example, Image = "entities/bob.png" will load "cache/entities/bob.png" if in online mode
- Removed ActionEffect entity class (But kept in SVN for possible re-install later)
- Fixed the custom mouse pointer not disappearing when the pointer was outside the SDL window
- Added mandatory inclusion of cache/scripts/main.lua (And all resources it requires) to maps, 
	after the Build() call of the primary lua file in order to inject common code regardless 
	if the mapper wants it or not. 

100416
- Added /facepalm and updated /troll
- Added Map.GetWorkingDir() to lua
- Fixed Map::mWorkingDir adjustment for test_map to properly work out of the dev/ directory
- Added various bits of the user blocking system. However, requires a system for saving addresses to 
	a lookup table, and an overall more robust method of blocking people. It will currently work, but
	can be circumvented if a blocked player just /join's the channel again
- Added background image to the login screen
- Added check for illegal 'sup' packets (mimicked from someone who wasn't the original creator to initialize
	a presence of themselves on the map, even without a valid client)

100423
- Added scrollbar visibility flag to Multiline widget. Can choose to always hide the scroller.
- Added info multiline to login screen, to output server connecting information 
- Login Screen will now remain visible until we actually go to the map loading state.
	Meaning, it will remain open while we're being verified by the server.
- Fixed private message button in trade window. Will now display the privmsg console at the top right.
- Added "entity" userdata to NET_LUA messenger event to point to the player that triggered the event
- Added "reqAvy" net message to request a privmsg of avatar information from a specific nick. 
- Fixed bug where avatars would not reload after unblocking a player.
- Added an additional cXXXX.YYYY. to the player movement buffer in order to fix position sync issues even more.
	(Although, it unfortunately makes the movement strings longer than one would like).
- Added a message to tell people to /join something if the world fails to load
	
100423 (After SVN commit to revision 20)
- Removed Game.NetSendToNick() in lua and replaced it with Game.NetSendToPlayer(entity, "id", "message")
	to avoid ambiguity in what it can actually do. (ie: Only works for players currently on the map)
- Added 5 second wait timer to avatar changing in the favorites, and removed the Die() command when an avy is selected.
- Removed Fashion Addict achievement (Wouldn't work with the above limitations in place)

(At this point, there is confirmation that it works on a fresh install of Windows 7 32bit
without either compatibility mode enabled, or security warnings, as seen with the previous release)

100428
- Fixed memory leak warning in SmallSelect widget
- Added server pinging with a 4 minute interval. If a response is not retrieved in that time, the client will
	know it's disconnected (An attempt to avoid the bug where it seemed we've been connected for hours, when we aren't).
- Added additional state to IrcNet, VERIFYING, to be activated while we're being verified as a valid client by the server
- Added IrcNet::mRealServerAddress to store the address of the actual server we are connected to, after being bounced. 
	(Common occurance on large IRC server networks)

100502
- Removed previous pinging system temporarily. Causing some weird bugs.

100507
- Removed renderCallback & eventCallback from Widget base (Unused)
- Removed uLong ms parameter from Widget::Render() (Unused)
- Added nick change nag message when someone joins a channel with a fro_* nick
- Removed a hack when parsing XmlFile's from const char* (Not necessarily fixed though)
- Fixed default avatar not loading when the profile does not yet exist. 

(SVN Commit to revision 21)

----- PUBLIC RELEASE AS 1.2.0 -----

100509
- Fixed 'ern' network message not being handled properly, and causing a crash
- Added logs/error.log reporting of warnings, fatals, and throws (Will append to the log).
- Added a marker file to detect when the client shuts down prematurely
- Fixed error occurances when reading profile save. 
- Fixed /wtf command to display the right emote
-
