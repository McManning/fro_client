Still a fucking horrible hack in XmlFile::LoadFromMemory, regarding the addition of a null terminator.
For the love of all that is holy, fix this!

Item boxes:
	Common image and behavior
	we'll start off simple, one item in the box. Eventually, we'll move onto multiple items with a pick window.
	Build it at first to actually support multiple items in the future, without changing how things are saved.
	
Add an option to disable achievement earned notifications



IMMEDIATE TODO:


- When someone puts <3 in chat, send heart emote instead. 
- When disconnected from server, the list of servers to connect to must be started from the beginning.
- Add Entity.SetImage?
- Drop IDs from widget constructors. We don't use them enough for it to be mandatory to supply
	But then Widget::Get("id") will be like "I NEED ID TO WORK" and leads to some confusion.. Eh.. 
- Add Image* of the screen to Widget::Render() so we don't have to Screen::Instance() constantly
	(Why didn't I do this before?)
- Add something that checks if they closed the client properly. If it wasn't, warn them.. or some such.
- Widget* w = gui->Get("MiniMenu");  Bug here, it won't delete on the next esc press unless we move it first.
- Clam Report:
	European, uses standard US keyboard but when the '" key is pressed, then a letter that isn't aeiouy,
	it'll fuck up. Probably trying to put accents on the letters. Try to test in Euro IME mode in windows, or some shit
	
	
TODO:
	- Rewrite movement buffer system to use a binary format to condense size considerably. 
	- Rewrite DataPacket to use binary rather than converting integers to strings and all that jazz.
	- http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=http://scripting.com/
		Will return just the url of the tinyurl. This service can be embedded into drm. 
	- Pack avatars into the savefile?
	- drm welfare check: comes in every week or so, gives you dorra
	- Need System.EncryptFile and System.DecryptFile for files (just for the hell of it, so we can 
		encrypt things like the farm file)
	-Allow object editing while map editing. And live updating the edited objects.
	-warp people to spawn if they are detected to be inside a solid object. 
		However, there could be an issue with solids moving around, and deciding to sit right onto the player. 
	-waypoint movement for actors
	-Add memorization for last map & last position (This can either be clientside or serverside)
	-Might need to send position correction post jump? Or if we hit a wall 

	-Add alphabetical sort button to avatar favorites and inventory
		Or a sort button that has a dropdown that's like "sort by name, sort by amount, etc"
	-Add some sort of crude lua call tracer to better track errors that cause the app to just die
	-Replace mJumpHeight with Z coordinate and add to ENTITY_MOVE
	-Dispatch ENTITY_MOVE more? (Such as every movement update, and include the Z coordinate)? 
		Not entirely sure if this is necessary. True, it helps keep accuracy, but when we do pathfinding and such, it'll
		cause re-pathing all too often (Of course, we could determine distance b/w current position and pathing destination,
		and if it's too far, it'll then repath. But still...)
	-Actor::CanMove needs to be finished. (Currently only checks if final destination is blocked, not the path to said destination)
	-Avatars use their _stop_ frames while in a jump, shouldn't it be _move_?
	-Should convert loopStand, loopSit, etc in avatars to a single integer with bit flags. 
	-Add avatar change locking
		Script it: Map.LockAvatar(1)
	-Fix reload previous world system in WorldLoader
	-Need to keep better track of who's on channels, and make sure we don't get privmsg's from people outside channels that should be on the chan.
	-GIFs with 0 delay actually have 0.1 second delays... should we do this in drm too?
	-need to change how warps work. I don't like setting destination map and object id in the OE itself. This should be per-map.. or something.
	-Add a max stamp counter, start deleting stamps if the max is hit.
	-ava dir live updating (or just general updater!111)
	-settable stamp rotation range, and size within a certain range

	-button image is fucked on trade for privmsg
	-privmsg shows up behind trade, not in front (trade is taking front priority~)
	-chatbox needs a button to send it to the bottom corner again, like before, so we can HIDE DAT SHIT
	-add font resizing for chatbox (and general system?)
	-Add an internal achievement for wallhacking (Derp)
	-If player data file doesn't exist, have a popup in the startup asking them if they want to set up
		basic settings for new users (Create an avatar, set a nickname, etc)

	-Not actually using entityType anywhere. Please do.
	- There's currently a bug with the Font class. Wrapping message rendering will ignore colors, due to calculation errors it creates. This needs to be resolved.
	- 
	
make some sort of drag & drop item crafting system.
If it doesnt' craft into something, it destroys all the items.
Otherwise, creates something awesome.
(Or another crafter that says NO if it can't craft with the current stuff)

	I send a movement buffer out when I join a channel.
	Right after said join.
	contents are: rcX.Y.

	Regarding downloading each objects xml, could simply make an xml document out of that xml's subsection from the map, and then
	save THAT to a file. Then we'd have object data continuously updated and good for editing. 
	But then again, do we want normal users to be able to edit shit? No we do not.

Jig is a prime example of someone who has difficulties with drm. There needs to be ways to simplify various things. This includes:
	-Updating the client. (Copying avatars to the new folder, unzipping, etc)
	-Setting avatar properties (like width/height)
	-Coloring names

	
	

Will not add ENTITYLEVEL_GUI. It's a stupid idea. Instead, add the ability to add onscreen text and images
without that crap (Widgets, or something). 

OR, give staticObject the ability to do this itself. Don't implement into every entity type, but allow SO's
and SO-inherited classes to do this. (This includes text, image displays, etc). Then maybe just add another basic
overlay layer that they can stick themselves in, but not necessarily force entities to have that prop. This way
we can have a weather overlay, but also have stuff under that, but which is still over actors. 

Then again, that's also problematic. Maybe add ENTITYLEVEL_SCREEN, but don't let Actors on it. Or, if they try, 
just have them behave like others, while StaticObjects will be screen relative. 
COULD give a mPositionRelativeToScreen value to Entity, but it'll only be used by SO's and their inherited forms...
(It needs to be in the base class so that we can query it while iterating through entities in map render and such)

smf2_themes stores the value of the custom value

would have to find a match for both id_member and variable 

Say, if we wanna access their start location, it would be:

smf2_themes:
	return 'value' where 'id_member' == myid and variable == 'cust_frosta'
	

Should add an "inventor" attribute to items.

issue with diff internal names than external..

When we package them into the - wait.. that's not a problem... because that crap is never stored.
Hurrrm... images will be a problem.. We have to do a subdir creation sort of check.. the downloader
should do that >:[

SOMETIMES lua reports an error in OnLoad, and other times it doesn't (basically every other time)
if we constantly test_map.. Is this skipping the func?



Add:

Need some HIDE ALL PLAYERS option, that basically turns everyone into floating orbs with names, but 
	you and the npcs. This way we can do certain things without intervention.
	(replaces all their avatars with something else. Not the block avy, but .. ya know)
